<h3>Storefronts and Progressive Web Apps</h3>

<p>
    With the rise of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), also several Storefront Projects were created.
    The difference between a Storefront and what OpenMage is the fact, that a Storefront is only meant to cover the
    frontend part and does not have a Backend or Admin Interface. Therefore the Storefronts usually connect with one of the
    existing eCommerce systems, using them via APIs as a so called Headless System.
</p>

<p>
    As one of the strengths of OpenMage is its Admin Interface, and building a PWA is an immense act of work, it is only
    naturally for us to partner up with the Storefront Projects out there. This way we can focus more on the
    Backend and API part, and offer you more flexibility in the choice of frontend technologies.
</p>


<h3>Partnerships with Providers of Storefronts</h3>

<p>
    As Part of the partnership we will keep the needs of the listed Storefronts in mind with our changes and make sure
    to not break functionality for them. Additionally we will listen closely and optimize the parts they use, and also
    slowly introduce specific functionality, to reduce the burden for them to maintain so called "bridge modules" for
    communication.
