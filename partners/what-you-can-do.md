## What you can do to support us


### on the Code Side

#### Participate in Code Reviews of Pull Requests

We get a lot of Patches already, but Reviewing them properly takes time, and the more people we have to Review,
the less Reviews each one of us has to do.

We usually require at least 2 approving Reviews for each PullRequest to ensure the quality and to catch potencial bugs early.
This has helped already many times to catch smaller Issues before they got merged.


#### Provide Bug Reports and Bug Fixes

Because we can only improve, what we know needs improvement.
And If they come with Patches already, even better.


#### Tag your compatible Modules

on Github, add the topic "openmage", so it is listed on [https://github.com/topics/openmage](https://github.com/topics/openmage)

in your composer.json, add "openmage" under "keywords", so its listed on [https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage](https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage)

### Organization

#### RFC Process
Help us form our future, by participating in the RFC Process.
[https://github.com/OpenMage/rfcs](https://github.com/OpenMage/rfcs)

Because some changes will need Backwards Compatibility Breaks, this ones should not be decided by just 3 people, but by the majority of theCommunity. (So the RFC Process is build to slow the process down, to make it possible for a lot more people to participate)
