## What you can do to support us


### on the Code Side

#### Participate in Code Reviews of Pull Requests

We get a lot of Patches already, but Reviewing them properly takes time, and the more people we have to Review,
the less Reviews each one of us has to do.

#### Provide Bug Reports and Bug Fixes

Because we can only improve, what we know needs improvement.

#### Tag your compatible Modules

on Github, add the topic "openmage", so it is listed on [https://github.com/topics/openmage](https://github.com/topics/openmage)

in your composer.json, add "openmage" under "keywords", so its listed on [https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage](https://packagist.org/search/?tags=openmage)
