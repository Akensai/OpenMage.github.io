title: Plan for the time after Magento 1 eol

One essential part of the Magento Ecosystem are the Marketplace and the big number of Modules
for every usecase.
But with the eol of Magento(1) its to expect, also the marketplace will get cleaned of
all the Magento(1) modules at one point.
This already happened once a few years back, when a lot of older modules got removed from the marketplace.

To ensure they are preserved and available for the OpenMage Project, we started a side Project.
The [OpenMage Module Fostering](https://github.com/OpenMageModuleFostering) is an Archive of
all the OpenSource Magento(1) Modules available via Magento Connect.
But this will only be the first step. Having them all on Github, also allows managing the continuation
of working on them through the community on a central place.

This will also help to make them all compatible with the future PHP8
and solve security related issues of unmaintained modules.

You want support us in maintaining, get in contact with us on Github, Twitter or via Discord.

Also, tell us what else would you like to see happen?
